== Description
  A thin wrapper for begin + rescue + sleep + retry.

== Installation
  gem install attempt   

== Synopsis
  require 'attempt'
   
  # Attempt to ftp to some host, trying 3 times with 30 seconds between
  # attempts before finally raising an error.
  #
  attempt(3, 30){
    Net::FTP.open(host, user, passwd){ ... }
  }
   
  # Or, do things the long way...
  code = Attempt.new{ |a|
    a.tries    = 3
    a.interval = 30
  }
   
  code.attempt{
    Net::FTP.open(host, user, passwd){ ... }
  }

  None that I'm aware of. If you find any bugs, please log them on the

== Caveats
  Use with caution. Specifically, make sure you aren't inadvertantly
  wrapping code that already performs sleep + retry. Otherwise, you'll
  end up with a series of nested retry's that could take much longer to
  work than you expect. 

  Also, this library uses the timeout library internally, which has some
  known issues. See Future Plans, below.

  As of version 0.3.0, this library requires structured_warnings 0.3.0 or
  later. This is necessary because of changes in Ruby 2.4.

== Future Plans
  Add the ability to set an absolute maximum number of seconds to prevent
  nested sleep/retry from delaying attempts longer than expected.

  Replace the timeout library with a self selecting pipe if possible.

== Acknowledgements
  This library is partially based on Mark Fowler's 'Attempt' Perl module.
