## Description
A thin wrapper for begin + rescue + sleep + retry.

## Installation
`gem install attempt`

## Adding the trusted cert
`gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djberg96/attempt/main/certs/djberg96_pub.pem)`

## Synopsis
```ruby
require 'attempt'

# Attempt to ftp to some host, trying 3 times with 30 seconds between
# attempts before finally raising an error.

attempt(tries: 3, interval: 30){
  Net::FTP.open(host, user, passwd){ ... }
}

# Or, do things the long way...
code = Attempt.new do |a|
  a.tries    = 3
  a.interval = 30
end

code.attempt{
  Net::FTP.open(host, user, passwd){ ... }
}
```

## Known Bugs
None that I'm aware of. If you find any bugs, please log them on the project page at:

## Caveats
Use with caution. Specifically, make sure you aren't inadvertantly
wrapping code that already performs sleep + retry. Otherwise, you'll
end up with a series of nested retry's that could take much longer to
work than you expect.

As of version 0.3.0, this library requires structured_warnings 0.3.0 or
later. This is necessary because of changes in Ruby 2.4.

In addition, the structured_warnings library requirement is now 0.4.0 or later
in order to work with Ruby 2.7+.

Originally this library used the timeout library and later the safe_timeout
library internally. However, as of 0.7.0 I've completely revamped the timeout
handling to allow for different (and better) timeout strategies. Please see
the documentation for details.

## Future Plans
Add the ability to set an absolute maximum number of seconds to prevent
nested sleep/retry from delaying attempts longer than expected.

~~Add a self selecting pipe timeout option if possible.~~ âœ… Completed in v0.8.0

## Acknowledgements
This library is partially based on Mark Fowler's 'Attempt' Perl module.
